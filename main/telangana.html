The rule was followed by the reign of prominent royal dynasties like the Vakataka, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas but the golden age of the Telangana region came under the reign of the Kakatiya dynasty which is attributed for most of the ancient architecture in this State. In the 14th century the city of Hyderabad came under the Delhi sultanate and the Nizams of Hyderabad which led to it becoming a princely State.
