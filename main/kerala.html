          <p>Kerala, southwestern coastal state of India. It is a small state, constituting only about 1 percent of the total area of the country. Kerala stretches for about 360 miles (580 km) along the Malabar Coast, varying in width from roughly 20 to 75 miles (30 to 120 km). It is bordered by the states of Karnataka (formerly Mysore) to the north and Tamil Nadu to the east and by the Arabian Sea to the south and west; it also surrounds Mahe, a segment of the state of Puducherry, on the northwestern coast. The capital is Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum).
          </p>
          <p>Although isolated from the Indian interior by the mountainous belt of the Western Ghats, Kerala has been exposed to many foreign influences via its long coastline; consequently, the state has developed a unique culture within the subcontinent, not only with a diverse religious tradition but also with its own language, Malayalam. Also notable is the high social status that continues to be accorded to women of Kerala, owing to the former strength of a matrilineal kinship system. Area 15,005 square miles (38,863 square km). Pop. (2011) 33,387,677.
          </p>  
          <p>Kerala is a region of great natural beauty. In the eastern part of the state, Anai Peak (8,842 feet [2,695 metres]), the highest peak of peninsular India, crowns the Western Ghats. Descending from the rocky highlands westward toward the coastal plain is a stretch of farmlands, with different crops cultivated at different elevations. Along the coast, a linked chain of lagoons and backwaters form the so-called Venice of India. Among the more important rivers that flow to the Arabian Sea are the Ponnani (Bharatapuzha), Periyar, Chalakudi, and Pamba.
          </p> 
          <p>The climate of Kerala is equable and varies little from season to season. Throughout the year, daily temperatures usually rise from the low 70s F (low 20s C) into the 80s F (27 to 32 °C). The state is directly exposed to the southwest monsoon, which prevails from July through September, but it also receives rain from the reverse (northeast) monsoon, which blows in October and November. Precipitation averages about 115 inches (3,000 mm) annually statewide, with some slopes receiving more than 200 inches (5,000 mm).

Enamoured by the enchanting scenic beauty of this backwater queen, Lord Curzon, the then viceroy of India (1st Decade of 20th Century) expressed his felicity by calling Alleppey the Venice of the East. The city is still famous with this sobriquet. There are numerous canals, beaches and especially backwaters which have made this place the most attractive tourist spot in Kerala. Alappuzha is also the headquarters of Alappuzha district.</p>
                     <p>The district of Alappuzha was formed in 1957. But the place has a long and rich historical as well as the mythological past. Kuttanad which is called the Rice Bowl of Kerala is the long land form with a huge stretch of paddy fields, rows of coconut and palm trees and numerous water bodies is the main physical characteristic of this place.

                      Historical evidences say that Alappuzha had its trade history with Greece and Portugal. Especially the Portuguese merchants and travelers had long been coming to this place since they arrived at Calicut. Therefore, besides trading, the Portuguese started preaching Catholicism and baptizing the resident Syrian Christians. But during 17th century the Portuguese influence started falling and the Dutch took important place and position in Alappuzha. They used to trade the spices mainly ginger, pepper and cinnamon, etc from here. But eventually they started spreading their inevitable influence on the culture and political affairs in Alappuzha until the ‘Maker of Modern Travancore’ Maharaja Marthanda Varma interceded.</p>
