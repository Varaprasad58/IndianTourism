According to the Aitareya Brahmana, the Andhras left North India from the banks of the Yamuna river and migrated to South India.[29][30] The Assaka Mahajanapada (700–300 BCE) was an ancient kingdom located between the Godavari and Krishna rivers in southeastern India. Accounts that people in the region are descended from the Viswamitra are found in the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas.[31][clarification needed] The region also derives its name from the Satavahanas, who are also known as Andhras, the earliest kings of Andhra Pradesh and India.</p>
